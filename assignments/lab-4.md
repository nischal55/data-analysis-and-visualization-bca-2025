# Lab 3: Exploring 1D Data Visualizations

## Objective

This lab will guide you through visualizing **one-dimensional (univariate)** data distributions using various plotting techniques. You will practice extracting key insights from **numerical** and **categorical** data using histograms, bar plots, pie charts, and box plots â€” essential tools in Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).

---

## Dataset Requirement

- Select **one real-world dataset** from **[Kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/)**
- Choose a dataset with both **numeric** and **categorical** 1D features.
- After each cell of visualizing data, include a short paragraph describing:
  - The dataset source
  - What it contains
  - The feature(s) you selected for each visualization
