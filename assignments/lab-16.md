# Lab 15. Software Tools

### NOTE:

You will have to upload images while submitting this assignment. Hence, make sure your images are all inside `lab-16-software-tools/<excel | matlab | tableu | java>` folder to make sure the images are committed in git.

## Part 1: MATLAB Visualization

### Task

Use **MATLAB** to visualize a dataset **other than the Iris dataset**. You may use any publicly available dataset (e.g., Wine Quality, Titanic, Pima Diabetes, Cars, etc.)

### Required Visualizations

- Histogram
- Scatter Plot
- Bar Chart
- Box Plot
- Pie Chart
- Line Chart
- Heatmap

### Instructions

1. Choose and load your dataset using `readtable()`, `load()`, or another appropriate method.
2. Generate the required visualizations. Make sure to:
   - Use `figure('Name', ..., 'NumberTitle', 'off')` to name your figures
   - Add clear `xlabel`, `ylabel`, and `title` to each plot
   - Use `legend()` where applicable
3. Add code + screenshot in your report (You dont need to submit the code and output in github, just when creating lab report for practical exam)
4. Make sure to attach screenshot of your output image of each visualization while pushing to github.

### Deliverables

- A MATLAB `.m` script file containing:
  - Code to load and inspect the dataset
  - Code for all visualizations
- Exported images of each figure

### Notes

- Do **not use the Iris dataset**
- If using MATLAB Online, remember free accounts are limited to **20 hours per month**

## Part 2: Excel

### Task

Use **Microsoft Excel** or **Excel Online** to visualize a dataset **other than the Iris dataset**. You may use any publicly available dataset (e.g., Cars, Sales, Movies, Students, etc.) with at least a few numeric and categorical columns.

### Required Visualizations

Create all **three** of the following charts in Excel:

- **Bar Chart**
- **Histogram**
- **Scatter Plot**

### Instructions

1. Open the dataset in Excel or upload it to Excel Online.
2. Organize the data as needed (headers, formatting, filtering).
3. Use Excelâ€™s **Insert > Chart** tools to create each of the required chart types.
4. Add proper:
   - **Chart title**
   - **Axis labels**
   - **Legend** (if applicable)
5. Use different chart styles, colors, or data labels to enhance clarity.

### Deliverables

- An `.xlsx` file containing your excel lab
- Screenshots of your output graphs
- Make sure to use this folder structure, or else the images will not be committed
- For lab report, you might have to print the excel sheet's data cells along with the generated visualizations

### Notes

- Do **not use the Iris dataset**

## Part 3: Tableu Visualization

### Task

Use **Tableau Public** or **Tableau Desktop** to visualize a dataset **other than the Iris dataset**. You may use any public dataset (e.g., Titanic, Superstore, Airbnb, Sales, or a dataset from previous coursework).

### Required Visualizations

Create **at least five** of the following chart types:

- **Bar Chart**
- **Scatter Plot**
- **Box Plot**
- **Histogram**
- **Pie Chart**

### Deliverables

- Tableau Workbook file (`.twbx`) OR a link to your **published dashboard** on Tableau Public
- Screenshots of final created dashboard

### Notes

- Do **not use the Iris dataset**
- Make sure your dataset has at least some numeric and categorical fields
